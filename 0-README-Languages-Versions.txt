Versions of Language Packs for Attachments-3 for Joomla 2.5+/3.x
================================================================

INSTALL these files using the regular Joomla installer (no need to unzip manually).

COMPATIBLITY:

   * Language packs starting with version 3.1 are for Attachments 3.1 
     for Joomla 2.5 or 3.x.

NOTES: 

   * If you need a language file for Attachments 3.0.x or cannot find a
     suiable 3.1 translation, please check the old attachments 3.0.x
     translations on joomlacode.org (these should work on Attachments 3.1 but
     will  be missing some translation items, especially in the backend):
     http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/attachments3/frs/?action=FrsReleaseView&release_id=15606

   * If you need a language file for Attachments 2.2, please visit the other, obsolete,
     attachments project on joomlacode: http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/attachments/
